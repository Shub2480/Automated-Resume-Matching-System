# Automated-Resume-Matching-System

I developed a system using Python and natural language processing (NLP) that helps a college placement cell shortlist resumes for job placements. The system extracts skills from the resumes and uses a BERT model to make embeddings of these skills. Based on the job description and required skills provided by the companies, the system shortlists relevant resumes for the companies. This saves time for the company HR as they don't have to manually go through all resumes and ensures that only relevant resumes are sent to the companies.
